Hybrid mobile application using Appgyver Supersonic as part of the CNVC (College New Venture Challenge).

Summary: 
The Habit Shop is a productivity app that helps users achieve their desired habit by rewarding them for completing a habit routine.

Why is it important:
According to a 2016 study performed at the University of Scranton, only 8% of Americans are successful in achieving their New Year’s Resolution. Millions of people experience difficulty in motivating themselves to complete self-improvement objectives. Some attempt to stay driven by downloading habit forming apps, but struggle because these apps merely track progress and don’t provide actual rewards. The Habit Shop can help Americans achieve their desired habits by providing extra motivation.

How it works:
Select a habit to work on. 
By set deadline, submit a proof that a habit is completed.
Earn raffle tickets. (The amount of raffle tickets varies on the specifics of the selected habit)
Use the tickets to apply for multiple raffles and win prizes.
We earn benefits from advertising revenue and sponsorships from apps.
Main costs are those that arise from raffle prizes.
